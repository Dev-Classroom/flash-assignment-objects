    // 1. Construct an object about this course. It must contain at least three properties. The values of those properties should be EITHER strings or integers.

    // 2. Write a statement that will log some information about your course to the console using dot-notation.

    // 3. Construct a second object about ANOTHER course. It should have the SAME properties, but obviously different values.

    // 4. Write a function which accepts a course as an argument and that uses dot-notation to output some information to the console from your object.
    // You should be able to plug either course in as an argument and the function should work!

    // 5. Write a function that contains two statements: one that modifies the value of a property from either course object, and a second statement
    // that alerts the user, via the console, about the modification. The function should accept two arguments: the object you're modifying and the
    // new value that's being assigned to a property.
